server development
------------------

To develop the server side of this project, you need
- Eclipse Indigo release
- Google App Engine SDK for Java
- GAE plug-in for Eclipse
- gson JSON library from google - a local copy is checked in to war/WEB-INF/lib

Assume the latest version of everything above.  Each time they are updated and something
breaks, let me know and I'll forward port anything needed.

check-in policy for non-source files
------------------------------------

The check-in policy is lax for this part of the project due to google mixing up
source configuration files with generated binary files.  To keep things simple,
we just therefore check in the war directory.  The thing we try to avoid is
checking in user-specific metadata files from eclipse (.classpath etc).
