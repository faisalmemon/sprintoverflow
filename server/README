server development
------------------

To develop the server side of this project, you need
- Eclipse Juno release
- Google App Engine plug-in for Eclipse (4.2) including its SDK
- gson JSON library (2.2.1) from google - a local copy is checked in to war/WEB-INF/lib

Assume the latest version of everything above.  Each time they are updated and something
breaks, let me know and I'll forward port anything needed.

check-in policy for non-source files
------------------------------------

The check-in policy is lax for this part of the project due to google mixing up
source configuration files with generated binary files.  To keep things simple,
we therefore check in the war directory.  The thing we try to avoid is
checking in user-specific metadata files from eclipse.  In order to get eclipse
working with git, we need the .project and .classpath meta files so the code can
be imported into an eclipse workspace.  Perhaps the classpath will need local
modification.
